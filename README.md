Capstone Project made on IBM cognos analtics 

For the Current Technology Usage dashboard, I focused on visualizing key metrics related to current technology usage trends. Utilizing the m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv dataset, I created these visualizations:

Top 10 LanguageWorkedWith: Presented as a bar chart with value labels, providing insights into the most used programming languages.
Top 10 DatabaseWorkedWith: Visualized as a column chart, highlighting the popular databases among developers.
PlatformWorkedWith: Represented using a word cloud chart, showcasing the various platforms worked with.
Top 10 WebFrameWorkedWith: Displayed as a hierarchy bubble chart, offering insights into the usage of web frameworks.
Moving on to the Future Technology Trend dashboard, I again utilized the m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv dataset to forecast upcoming technology trends. Here's how I visualized the data:

Top 10 LanguageDesireNextYear: Visualized as a bar chart to illustrate the desired programming languages for the future.
Top 10 DatabaseDesireNextYear: Presented as a column chart, indicating the desired databases for the upcoming year.
PlatformDesireNextYear: Represented using a tree map chart, highlighting the desired platforms for the future.
Top 10 WebFrameDesireNextYear: Displayed as a hierarchy bubble chart, providing insights into the desired web frameworks for the future.
Lastly, for the Demographics dashboard, I utilized the m5_survey_data_demographics.csv dataset to explore demographic insights. Here's how I visualized the demographic data:

Gender Distribution: Visualized as a pie chart with percentage display, showcasing the distribution of respondents by gender.
Respondent Count for Countries: Represented as a map chart, indicating the distribution of respondents across different countries.
Respondent Count by Age: Visualized as a line chart with markers and value labels, offering insights into the age distribution of respondents.
Respondent Count by Gender and Formal Education Level: Displayed as a stacked bar chart, highlighting the distribution of respondents by gender and formal education level.
Overall, by following these steps and utilizing the features of IBM Cognos Analytics, I successfully created three informative dashboards that provide valuable insights into current technology usage, future trends, and demographic characteristics of the surveyed populationâ€”all accomplished independently.
